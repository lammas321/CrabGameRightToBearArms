# CrabGameRightToBearArms
A small BepInEx mod for Crab Game that lets you use the Rifle and Double Barrel items that are usually banned.

## What does this do?
It changes the names of the Rifle and Double Barrel to AK and Dual Shotgun, bypassing the banned item check and allowing them to be used AND deal damage.

Additionally for fun, it allows the Milk and Pizza items to be picked up and held in your fourth inventory slot.
- NOTE: Players without this mod will not see or be able to hold the Milk or Pizza item in their fourth slot when they pick them up, but it will drop when they pick up another item that goes in the fourth slot or if they die

## How can I obtain these items?
If you are using [ChatCommands](https://github.com/lammas321/CrabGameChatCommands), this mod will add the !items and !give command, allowing you to give yourself or anyone else any item in the game with any amount of ammo.
