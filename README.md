# CrabGameRightToBearArms
A small BepInEx mod for Crab Game that lets you use the Rifle and Double Barrel items that are usually banned.

## What does this do?
It changes the names of the Rifle and Double Barrel to AK and Dual Shotgun, bypassing the banned item check and allowing them to be used AND deal damage. (Server Side)

Additionally for fun, it allows the Milk and Pizza Steve items to be picked up and held in your fourth inventory slot. (Server + *Optional* Client Side)
- NOTE: Players without this mod will not see or be able to hold the Milk or Pizza item in their fourth slot when they pick them up, but it will drop when they pick up another item that goes in the fourth slot or if they die

## How can I obtain these items?
If you are using [ChatCommands](https://github.com/lammas321/CrabGameChatCommands), this mod will add the !items and !give command, allowing you to give yourself or anyone else any item in the game with any amount of ammo.
- As of v1.1.0, ChatCommands is now an optional dependency, so you don't need ChatCommands to be able to properly pick up items you normally can't.

Without ChatCommands, you can either pick up the Pizza Steve to the left of the rock in the middle of Slippery Slope, or join another lobby that's using RightToBearArms and pick up Milk or Pizza Steve's they may spawn.
